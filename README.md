# Computer-Vision-Project
Speech bubble detection with Deep learning

The first part will be an expert based program that will detect Speech Bubbles in comics using advanced computer vision algorithm.

The second part will be a Deep Learning program that will do the same. It will be created in Google Collab to enable fast training.
